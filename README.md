# UI-Designing-of-a-Mobile-Health-Application
The UI-UX designing of a mobile health app in Figma.

This project was designed entirely in Figma, a web-based application to design Web pages or app pages fully integrated inside your browser.
The .fig file contains the Design and Prototyping of the Health App. 
The UI is prototyped to maximize user accessibility. The interface is made to match modern aesthetics as far as possible. 
The Health App has a Login/ Sign-up page, after that, it takes you to a home page. From the home page, the user can access various parts of the app with a single click and minimum effort.
Features of the app include being able to video chat, text chat, book appointments, sync up your blood sugar appliances/tools, monitor heart rate, and blood pressure, and much more.
All that's left is to add the backend of the app and it will be truly complete! :)
